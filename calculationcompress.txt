nfhnkdjjjuggjgghnfc  16 characters to compress, 15 possible characters used
20922789880000 possibilities which is the same number of possible 16 char combinations with the predefined characterset
a 3d cartesian plane is simulated, the end of the axes will be the cube root of the number of possibilities = 27555.38804 rounded up to 27556
wordlists are created systematically, with the 3 coordinates, the exact value from  a wordlist can be calculated. since the wordlits generation is systematic, then you can caluclate the value of that exact value by reversing the permutation formula used by tools like crunch.

with 3200 character blocks, the max values will be aproximately 98.5% the size of the original.
